# Descent 2E Randomizer.

An android (and possibly iOS, it should work on iOS too, but it's not tested) companion app for Descent 2E used to radomize diverse things in the game.

It is commonly used with [Redjak's Automated Overlord Variant](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1350077/redjaks-automated-overlord-variant-v4) to randomly draw open monster groups, overlord decks and plot decks.

All the expansions are planned to be supported, currently only the base set, Chains that Rust and Shadow of Nerekhall are supported.

## FAQ

### Why isn't the app on the store?
It was rejected due to use of copyrighted content. I may try to go around this by at some point, but I'm not really good in design, so if someone wants to help, I'll be glad to try to publish again.

### Will you support the expansion X?
Most likely, yes. If you really want an expansion to be added to the app, just open an issue and I'll implement that one next.
